These min and max limits for the mass-radius relation were created using mass radius relationships from Burrows 2011 for Brown Dwarfs (below 0.1 solar masses), and mass-radius relationships from MIST () for main sequence stars. Using the full range of parameters in both papers, the minimum and maximum radii for each stellar mass were saved. A smooth interpolation was done to connect the region between Brown Dwarfs and MS stars. The variation in maximum radius for 0.1 solar mass stars between the two models was ~0.03 solar radii. The variation in minimum radius for 0.1 solar mass stars between the two models was ~0.02 solar radii. 


-- also used gaussian filter to smooth the connection region for max radii, and to smooth the variation for max radii at high masses (>30 solar masses), as it was very sharp which is difficult for mcmc. There was very little change to the radii. The largest change was at ~57 solar masses, where the change in radii was ~3 solar radii (from ~158 to ~155).
